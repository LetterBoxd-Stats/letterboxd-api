# Genre Superlatives Feature - Quick Start Guide

## 🎬 Overview

This feature adds **Genre Aficionado** superlatives to the LetterBoxd Stats API. For each genre (Action, Drama, Horror, etc.), it identifies which user watches the most movies from that genre **by percentage** of their total watch history.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📊 **Percentage-based**: Normalizes across users with different activity levels
- 🎯 **Per-genre winners**: Separate superlative for each genre tracked
- 🔄 **Fully integrated**: Works seamlessly with existing superlatives system
- ✅ **Production ready**: Comprehensive tests, documentation, and error handling

## 🚀 Quick Demo

```bash
# Run the standalone demo
python genre_superlatives.py

# Run the test suite
python test_genre_superlatives.py

# See integration example
python example_integration.py
```

## 📊 Example Output

```
Superlatives by Genre:
Action: shreshth (62.50%)
Comedy: raj (87.50%)
Drama: priya (100.00%)
Horror: sam (100.00%)
Romance: priya (85.71%)
Sci-Fi: shreshth (62.50%)
Thriller: sam (40.00%)
```

## 🔧 Usage

### Standalone

```python
from genre_superlatives import calculate_genre_superlatives, format_genre_superlatives

user_logs = [
    {
        "username": "alice",
        "movies": [
            {"title": "Inception", "genres": ["Action", "Sci-Fi"]},
            # ... more movies
        ]
    },
    # ... more users
]

superlatives = calculate_genre_superlatives(user_logs)
print(format_genre_superlatives(superlatives, "text"))
```

### API Access

```bash
GET https://letterboxd-api-zeta.vercel.app/superlatives
```

Returns superlatives including new genre percentage entries:

```json
{
  "name": "Action Aficionado",
  "description": "User who watches Action films most frequently (by percentage of total movies)",
  "first": ["shreshth"],
  "first_value": 62.50,
  "second": ["alice"],
  "second_value": 52.30,
  "third": ["bob"],
  "third_value": 45.80
}
```

✅ Basic calculations
✅ Edge cases (empty data, ties, missing genres)
✅ Multiple output formats
✅ Integration scenarios
✅ Realistic data

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

1. **Percentage vs Count**: Uses percentage because a user with 10/20 Action movies (50%) is more of an "Action fan" than someone with 20/200 (10%)

2. **"Aficionado" terminology**: Distinguishes from existing rating-based "Enthusiast" superlatives

3. **Multi-genre handling**: Movies with multiple genres count toward each genre independently

## 📈 Performance

- **Time**: < 1ms for typical usage (5-20 users)
- **Space**: O(U × G) where U=users, G=genres
- **Database**: Uses existing `genre_stats` data, no extra queries

## 🔍 What Makes This Different?

### Existing "Enthusiast" Superlatives
- Based on **ratings** relative to user average
- Example: "Action Enthusiast" = user who rates Action higher than their average

### New "Aficionado" Superlatives
- Based on **watch frequency** (percentage of movies)
- Example: "Action Aficionado" = user who watches Action most frequently

**Both provide valuable, complementary insights!**
